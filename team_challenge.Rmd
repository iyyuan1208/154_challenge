# Data Cleaning

We began our analysis by first loading the training data set and then examine the predicators.

```{r}
data <- read.csv('data/cs-training.csv')
colnames(data)
```

## Portion of defaulted
```{r}
mean(data$SeriousDlqin2yrs)
```


We then check which of these features have null data and how many.

```{r}
apply(is.na(data[,2:12]), 2, sum)
```

This suggests that only monthly income and number of depedents have missing data.
