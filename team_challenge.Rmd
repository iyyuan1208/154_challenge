# Data Cleaning

We began our analysis by first loading the training data set and then examine the predicators.

```{r}
data <- read.csv('data/cs-training.csv')
colnames(data)
```

## Portion of defaulted
```{r}
mean(data$SeriousDlqin2yrs)
```


We then check each feature with summary() and see which of these features have null data and how many.

```{r}
data_col <- colnames(data)
for(i in 2:12){
  print(data_col[i])
  print(summary(data[,i]))
}
```
This suggests that only monthly income and number of dependents have missing data, which we would later either fill in or drop.


```{r}
train_complete<- complete.cases(data)
data_drop<- cbind(data,train_complete)
data_drop<- subset(data_drop,data_drop$train_complete == TRUE)
```
These code above give us the dataframe with incompleted observations dropped
